## Test with a forked mainnet.

Deploy a forked mainnet from hardhat using:

```
npx hardhat node --fork https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/<YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY>
```

Create your alchemy account and run that command with your api key.
This will allow hardhat to fetch data from the mainnet.

## Funding a random wallet

`scripts/fund.js` will transfer funds from one of the accounts generated by hardhat to a hardcoded account. I mixed this with the forked mainnet to directly transfer to my own wallet so that I could test the deployed contract from a separate user interface. remember to use `--network local` and to replace the hardcoded address in `scripts/fund.js` with one of your own if you want to access this feature.

## Tests

Ignore the `test` folder, we depend on a forked mainnet so quick tests are out of the table by now.

The actual tests must be done by directly interacting with the contract.
